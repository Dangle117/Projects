# 📚 All My Projects

Welcome to my collection of coding projects! This folder contains everything I’ve built and experimented with — from simple games to useful tools and apps.

Each folder inside represents a separate project, complete with its own code, README, and sometimes extra files like requirements or assets.

## 🔎 What's Inside

Here are a few examples of what you might find:

- 🎮 **Hangman Game** – A classic arcade game written in Python.
- 🌦️ **Weather App** – A desktop app showing real-time weather (PyQt5).
- 🎰 **Spinning Game** – A fun slot-style game using emojis.
- 🔐 **Strong Password Validator** – Basic file security using Python.
- 🧠 **Mastermind Game** – A simple logic puzzle game.

More are being added as I keep learning and building!

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

What I've used on the project:

- Python (main language)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
- VS Code (my main code editor)
- `rich` library (design terminal)

## 🏁 How to Run a Project

1. Go into a project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the README.md file inside that folder.
3. Use a virtual environment if needed (.venv):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    # or
    source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
