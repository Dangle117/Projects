# 📚 All My Projects

Welcome to my collection of coding projects! This folder contains everything I’ve built and experimented with — from simple games to useful tools and apps.

Each folder inside represents a separate project, complete with its own code, README, and sometimes extra files like requirements or assets.

## 🔎 What's Inside

Here are a few examples of what you might find:

- 🎮 **Hangman Game** – A classic arcade game written in Python.
- 🌦️ **Weather App** – A desktop app showing real-time weather (PyQt5).
- 🎰 **Spinning Game** – A fun slot-style game using emojis.
- 🔐 **Strong Password Validator** – Basic file security using Python.
- 🧠 **Mastermind Game** – A simple logic puzzle game.

More are being added as I keep learning and building!

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

What I've used on the project:

- Python (main language)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
- VS Code (my main code editor)
- `rich` library (design terminal)

## 🏁 How to Run a Project

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dangle117/Projects.git
    cd project-name
   ```

2. Navigate into any project folder:

Example:
   ```bash
    cd mastermind_game
    python mastermind.py
   ```

3. Make sure to install any required dependencies (usually noted in the project folder’s `README.md` or in `pyproject.toml` if available).

## 📦 Requirements (Common)

- Python 3.7 or newer
- rich library for styled terminal output
- PyQt5 for GUI-based apps

## 📌 Notes
